// Benjamin recently bought a digital clock at a magic trick shop. The seller never told Ben
// what was so special about it, but mentioned that one day Benjamin would be faced with a surprise.
// Indeed, the clock did surprise Benjamin: without warning, at someTime the clock
// suddenly started going in the opposite direction! Unfortunately, Benjamin has
// an important meeting very soon, and knows that at leavingTime he should leave the house
// so as to not be late.Ben spent all his money on the clock, so has to figure out what time
// his clock will show when it's time to leave.
// Given the someTime at which the clock started to go backwards, find out what time
// will be shown on the curious clock at leavingTime.
// For your convenience, here is the list of months lengths (from January to December, respectively):
//          Months lengths: 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31.
// Please, note that in leap years February has 29 days.
// Example:
//          For someTime = "2016-08-26 22:40" and leavingTime = "2016-08-29 10:00", the output should be
//          curiousClock(someTime, leavingTime) = "2016-08-24 11:20".
//          There are 2 days, 11 hours and 20 minutes till the meeting.
//          Thus, the clock will show 2016-08-24 11:20 at the leavingTime.
