// Elections are in progress!
// Given an array of the numbers of votes given to each of the candidates so far,
// and an integer k equal to the number of voters who haven't cast their vote yet,
// find the number of candidates who still have a chance to win the election.
// The winner of the election must secure strictly more votes than any other candidate.
// If two or more candidates receive the same (maximum) number of votes, assume there is no winner at all.
// Example:
//          For votes = [2, 3, 5, 2] and k = 3, the output should be
//          electionsWinners(votes, k) = 2.
//          The first candidate got 2 votes.Even if all of the remaining 3 candidates vote for him,
//          he will still have only 5 votes, i.e.the same number as the third candidate, so there will be no winner.
//          The second candidate can win if all the remaining candidates vote for him (3 + 3 = 6 > 5).
//          The third candidate can win even if none of the remaining candidates vote for him.
//          For example, if each of the remaining voters cast their votes for each of his opponents,
//          he will still be the winner(the votes array will thus be [3, 4, 5, 3]).
//          The last candidate can't win no matter what (for the same reason as the first candidate).
//          Thus, only 2 candidates can win(the second and the third), which is the answer.
